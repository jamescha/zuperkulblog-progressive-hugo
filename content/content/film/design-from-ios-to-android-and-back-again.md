Designing and developing between platforms is a lot like traveling through different countries. You go through the same motions — sleeping, eating, sightseeing, regardless of where you are — but the customs of the country you’re visiting dictate how you go about doing them. In some countries, it’s ok to push people into the train, or eat a burger with a knife and fork. Similarly, if you developed your product first for iOS, you shouldn’t simply expect that you can port it into Android without issue, because your app will feel lost in translation. It’s important to understand the idioms and behaviors of each platform before you start design and development. That way your users will be able to use and easily understand your app on the platform that is native to them, and you will have the most clear and true version of your product — no matter where it’s used. This guide will walk you through some practical tips for moving from iOS to Android (and back again) without suffering a cultural divide.
