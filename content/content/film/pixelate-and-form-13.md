Weâ€™re thrilled to announce that Pixate has joined Google! Pixate adds to our ongoing effort to develop new design and prototyping tools, including Form 1.3. Explore the latest features of both products below, and check out our roundtable conversation with Matias Duarte, VP Design at Google, and the the founders of Pixate and Form. A visual prototyping platform that allows designers to create sophisticated, fluid mobile prototypes that run natively on iOS and Android devices. Creating complete app prototypes or crafting carefully choreographed interactions that look and feel completely real, and sharing them so entire product teams or clients can experience them right on their device.
